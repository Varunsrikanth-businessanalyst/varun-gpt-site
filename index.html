    a:`Strengths and Weaknesses
As a Product Manager, one of my biggest strengths is my ability to drive data-backed product decisions while optimizing processes to improve efficiency and customer experience. If you ask my previous stakeholders, they would say Varun is someone who takes complete ownership, collaborates cross-functionally, and continuously seeks ways to enhance product usability, automation, and operational impact. I prioritize customer needs by analyzing data, gathering insights, and aligning teams to deliver meaningful improvements.

Weaknesses
One area I’ve been working on is balancing my attention to detail. I naturally focus on accuracy, but at times, it can slow me down when working under tight deadlines. Another thing is that I find it hard to say NO to people, which sometimes leads to taking on more than I can handle. I’m actively working on this and learning to say NO.`
